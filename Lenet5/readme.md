# Training and Testing the LeNet5 Model
This project implements the LeNet5 model to classify the MNIST dataset with various regularization techniques: Dropout, Weight Decay (L2 Regularization), and Batch Normalization. The following instructions will guide you on how to train the model under each setting and how to test it using the saved weights.

## Training the Model
To train model:
```python main.py```

## Testing the Model with Saved Weights
```python test.py none```
```python test.py dropout```
```python test.py l2```
```python test.py batch_norm```
