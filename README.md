# Cornell CS 5787: Deep Learning

This repository is for the Cornell CS 5787 course on Deep Learning. It contains implementations of several classical deep learning models, including:

- **LeNet5** (using MNIST dataset)
- **RNN** (using PTB dataset)
  - `LSTM`
  - `GRU`
- **VAE** (using MNIST dataset and SVM classifier)
- **GAN** (using MNIST dataset)
  - `DCGAN`
  - `WGAN`
